    <h1 class="page-title">So, You Want to Measure Your Body Fat Percentage?</h1>

    <p class="intro-text">
        Let's get one thing straight: getting an exact measurement of your body fat percentage is like trying to catch a
        greased pig at a county fair. Unless you're willing to hop into an MRI machine (and trust me, if a hospital lets
        you use an MRI for something this trivial, you should probably find another hospital), you're not going to get a
        truly accurate number. But that's okay! We’re not here for precision down to the last decimal point. Instead,
        let's keep things simple with a good old chart to get a ballpark figure. Remember that everybody has different
        fat distribution, so don't only look at the midsection but consider every part of your body from your arms to
        your legs.
    </p>

    <p class="intro-text">
        Below, you'll find a chart that will help you estimate your body fat percentage based on visual cues. It’s not
        rocket science, but it’s good enough for our purposes.

    <p class="outro-text">
        Remember, this chart is just an estimate. Your body is unique, and numbers can only tell you so much. So, use
        this visual as a guide, and don’t stress about hitting a specific percentage. It’s all about getting a general
        idea so you can make informed decisions on your fitness journey.
