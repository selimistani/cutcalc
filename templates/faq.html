                <h3>Who Created This Calculator and Why?</h3>
                <p>Hey, I'm Selim. I've been into bodybuilding since I was 12 years old and have been finding stuff to
                    make
                    or calculate to procrastinate actually working out ever since then. Hence, why this was created,
                    along
                    with being my final project for the CS50x program :).</p>
            </div>

            <div id="q2" class="faq-item">
                <h3>What is the Purpose of This Calculator?</h3>
                <p>The purpose of this calculator is to help you set a plan for a cut while losing as little muscle as
                    possible. It assumes that you should lose your BFP% / 20 percent of your body weight, which is based
                    on
                    a study that I admittedly forgot (but you can trust me, I did sports science in IB).</p>
            </div>

            <div id="q3" class="faq-item">
                <h3>How Accurate is the Body Fat Percentage (BFP) Measurement?</h3>
                <p>It depends on how well your eyes work. If you think you’re overestimating, add 2-3% to whatever
                    number
                    you come up with.</p>
            </div>

            <div id="q4" class="faq-item">
                <h3>How Do I Know Which Activity Level to Choose?</h3>
                <p>If you're unsure, pick an activity level that feels closest to your typical day. If you’re overly
                    optimistic about how active you are, you might end up overestimating how many calories you burn.</p>
            </div>

            <div id="q5" class="faq-item">
                <h3>What Happens if I Don’t Know My Body Fat Percentage?</h3>
                <p>If you don’t know your BFP, the calculator will use a different method to estimate your maintenance
                    calories. It’s less accurate, but it’s better than guessing blindly.</p>
            </div>

            <div id="q6" class="faq-item">
                <h3>Can I Trust the Results from This Calculator?</h3>
                <p>Take everything with a grain of salt. TL;DR: These are estimates, and while they’re based on science,
                    your body isn’t a simple math equation.</p>
            </div>

            <div id="q7" class="faq-item">
                <h3>Why Do the Calorie Recommendations Seem Different from Other Calculators?</h3>
                <p>The other ones suck. Kidding, but really, this calculator uses the Katch-McArdle equation, which is a
                    bit
                    more precise—especially if you know your body fat percentage.</p>
            </div>

            <div id="q8" class="faq-item">
                <h3>Can I Manually Adjust the Values if I Think They’re Wrong?</h3>
                <p>I’m too lazy to code this in (I admit it). But feel free to tweak the numbers in your head if you
                    think
                    they’re off.</p>
            </div>

            <div id="q9" class="faq-item">
                <h3>How Should I Use the Results from This Calculator?</h3>
                <p>Use an app like MyFitnessPal to track your calories. If your weight loss seems way off after two
                    weeks,
                    adjust accordingly. Keep in mind that the first two weeks can be unreliable as you lose water weight
                    and
                    stuff.</p>
            </div>

            <div id="q10" class="faq-item">
                <h3>What Are the Limitations of This Calculator?</h3>
                <p>This calculator provides estimates, not guarantees. It assumes everyone is a bit average, which we
                    both
                    know isn't true, so consider your unique factors when using it.</p>
            </div>

            <div id="q11" class="faq-item">
                <h3>Why Do I Need to Know My Lean Body Mass (LBM)?</h3>
                <p>Your LBM helps to calculate how many calories your body burns at rest, which is crucial for
                    estimating
                    your maintenance calories more accurately.</p>
            </div>

            <div id="q12" class="faq-item">
                <h3>How Often Should I Update My Data in the Calculator?</h3>
                <p>Once is enough, really. Your LBM and BFP% don’t change drastically overnight, so don’t stress about
                    updating constantly.</p>
            </div>

            <div id="q13" class="faq-item">
                <h3>Is It Safe to Follow the Calorie Recommendations Provided?</h3>
                <p>It should be, but always consult a health professional before making any drastic changes to your diet
                    or
                    exercise routine.</p>
            </div>

            <div id="q14" class="faq-item">
                <h3>What If I Lose Weight Too Quickly or Too Slowly?</h3>
                <p>If your weight loss is off after two weeks, start worrying. The first two weeks can be unpredictable
                    due
                    to water weight fluctuations, so give it some time before you make adjustments.</p>
            </div>

            <div id="q15" class="faq-item">
                <h3>Why Does the Activity Level Section Mention Outdated Research?</h3>
                <p>We have no other research to go on, but it’s optional and still a decent rule of thumb (ish).
                    Consider it
                    a starting point rather than gospel.</p>
            </div>

            <div id="q16" class="faq-item">
                <h3>Can I Use This Calculator for Gaining Weight or Building Muscle?</h3>
                <p>Not sure how you would for now, but I plan on adding this functionality later after I learn proper UX
                    /
                    web design. Stay tuned!</p>
            </div>

            <div id="q17" class="faq-item">
                <h3>Why Do I Need to Trust the Charts for BFP Estimation?</h3>
                <p>The charts are there to give you a rough idea. No method outside of advanced medical imaging is going
                    to
                    be 100% accurate, so use them as a general guide rather than an absolute measure.</p>
            </div>

            <div id="q18" class="faq-item">
                <h3>How Do I Measure My Height and Weight Accurately for the Best Results?</h3>
                <p>Measure your height and weight in the morning, naked (I know, eewwww), and after using the restroom.
                    This
                    gives you the most consistent baseline.</p>
            </div>

            <div id="q19" class="faq-item">
                <h3>What Should I Do if I Don’t See Any Progress?</h3>
                <p>If you’re not seeing progress, revisit your inputs and consider adjusting your calorie intake or
                    activity
                    level. Sometimes, it’s just a matter of tweaking the numbers and being patient.</p>
