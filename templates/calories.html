    <h1 class="page-title">How We Calculate Your Maintenance Calories</h1>

    <p class="intro-text">
        So, you want to know how many calories you should be consuming to maintain your current weight? The calculator
        we’ve put together uses a few different methods to estimate your maintenance calories, and well, it’s not that
        much more accurate than trying to wing it, if we're really being honest.
    </p>

    <h2 class="section-title">Katch-McArdle Equation</h2>

    <p class="section-text">
        If you’ve filled out the body fat percentage field (and why wouldn’t you?), the calculator will opt for the
        Katch-McArdle Formula, which is basically the gold standard in the world of calorie estimation. This formula
        requires you to know your Lean Body Mass (LBM), because unlike some other formulas, it actually cares about
        what’s underneath the surface.
    </p>

    <div class="formula-container">
        <h3 class="formula-title">Katch-McArdle Equation</h3>
        <p class="section-text">To calculate your Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR), we use the Katch-McArdle equation:</p>

        <div class="formula-wrapper">
            <p class="formula"><strong>BMR = 370 + (21.6 * LBM [kg])</strong></p>
        </div>

        <p class="section-text">
            Don’t worry, you don’t need to whip out your calculator—this is all done automatically for you.
        </p>

    <h2 class="section-title">Weight Loss Calculation: The Rule of Thumb</h2>

    <p class="section-text">
        We also incorporate a rule of thumb to estimate how much of your body weight you can safely lose without
        sacrificing muscle mass. This guideline suggests that you can lose up to <strong>BFP% / 20</strong> of your body
        weight.
        While this is a trusted rule, it's important to remember that it isn't exact, but it provides a useful
        estimation.
    </p>

    <h2 class="section-title">Activity Level</h2>

    <p class="section-text">
        Now, let’s talk about your activity level. This value helps us figure out how many extra calories you’re burning
        each day (on top of your BMR) by just being your fabulous, active self. But here’s the kicker: this number is
        pretty damn speculative. Even the World Health Organization (WHO) isn’t thrilled that people are still using
        these multipliers, which were based on studies from the 1950s involving Italian men. Not exactly cutting-edge
        science, right?
    </p>

    <p class="section-text">
        If you’re the cautious type, you might want to choose a lower activity level and then track any additional
        calories burned through exercise or other activities using logs or diaries—there are plenty available online.
        For those of you who like to keep things simple, you can stick with the standard multipliers. I’ve even thrown
        in a few extra categories for good measure, so you have some additional flexibility.
